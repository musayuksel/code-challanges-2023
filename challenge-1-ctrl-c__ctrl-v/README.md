# Challenge 1 - "Control C, Control V"

Welcome back! Here's a fun little string manipulation challenge to kick things off. The challenge is to analyse strings for any instances of `[CTRL+C]` and `[CTRL+V]`. When `[CTRL+C]` is encountered, the contents of the string before it should be 'copied' to a clipboard. Upon any instance of `[CTRL+V]` in the string, this clipboard should be pasted in its place. \*If `[CTRL+V]` is encountered before any corresponding `[CTRL+C]` then it should simply paste nothing\*.

# Rewards:

:five: Points are awarded for a working algorithm as described above.

:three: Further points are awarded for supporting `[CTRL+X]`, which should remove the preceding text before copying it to the clipboard

:two: Further points are awarded for validating your solution with a collection of unit tests

## Example input:

```
challenge("the first[CTRL+C] Coding Challenge was [CTRL+V] string manipulation task");

```

## Output

```
"the first Coding Challenge was the first string manipulation task"
```

## Install

```
yarn
```

## Testing

```
yarn test
```

## Good luck :)
